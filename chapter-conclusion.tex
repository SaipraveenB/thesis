\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter-conclusion}

In this thesis, we have developed a logical framework of substructural
logical specifications (\sls) based on a rewriting interpretation of
ordered linear lax logic (\ollll). Part I of the thesis discussed the
design of this logical framework, and in the process firmly
established the elegant connection between two sets of techniques:

\smallskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item Canonical forms and hereditary
substitution in a logical framework, on one hand, and 
\item Focused derivations and cut
admissibility in logic, on the other.
\end{enumerate}

\smallskip
\noindent 
The existence of this connection has been known for a decade, but this
thesis gives the first account of the connection that generalizes to
all logical connectives. This connection allowed the \sls~framework to
be presented as a syntactic refinement of focused ordered linear lax
logic; the steps and traces of \sls, which provide its rewriting
interpretation, are justified as partial proofs in focused ordered
linear lax logic. \sls~does move beyond the connection with focused
logic due to the introduction of concurrent equality, which allows
logically independent steps in a trace to be reordered; we conjecture
that the resulting equivalence relation imposed on our logical
framework is analogous to the one given by multifocusing in logic.

The \sls~framework acts as a bridge between the world of logical
frameworks, where deductive derivations are the principal objects of
study, and the world of rewriting logic, where rewriting sequences
that are similar to \sls~traces are the principal objects of
study. Part II of this thesis discusses a number of ways of describing
operational semantics specifications in \sls, using ordered resources
to encode control structures, using mobile/linear resources to encode
mutable state and concurrent communication, and using persistent
resources to represent memoization and binding. Different styles of
specification were connected to each other through automatic and
fully-correct transformations on \sls~specifications, a methodology we
named the {\it logical correspondence}. Utilizing these
transformations, it is possible to fuse together a single coherent
\sls~specification of a MiniML language with concurrency, state, and
communication using various different styles of specification,
including natural semantics where appropriate. This is demonstrated in
Appendix~\ref{appendix-hybrid}.

% \sls~still hews more
% closely to the tradition of logical frameworks, but future work will
% hopefully reduce the remaining distance between operational semantics
% specifications in \sls~and rewriting logic-based approaches to
% operational semantics specifications.

This thesis also discussed two different modes of reasoning formally
about operational semantics specifications in \sls. The first mode,
the program analysis methodology considered in
Chapter~\ref{chapter-approx}, allows us to derive effectively
executable abstractions of an operational semantics directly from an
operational semantics specification in \sls. The second mode, the
methodology of progress, preservation, and type safety, is considered
in Chapter~\ref{chapter-gen} and Chapter~\ref{chapter-safety}. In a
sense, this thesis has pushed our ability to reason {\it formally}
about properties of \sls~specifications (and substructural operational
semantics specifications in particular) some distance beyond our
ability to {\it informally} reason about these specifications. An
important direction for future work is moving beyond the
misleadingly-sequential language of \sls~traces and developing a more
user-friendly language for writing, talking, and thinking about 
traces in \sls, especially generative traces.
