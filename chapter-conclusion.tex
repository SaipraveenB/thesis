\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter-conclusion}




The approximation methodology presented in
Chapter~\ref{chapter-approx} is also relevant to this refinement of
the thesis statement. Program abstraction is also a form of formal
reasoning about the properties of the programming language. One the
other hand, approximation is a program transformation like
operationalization, defunctionalization, and destination adding, which
is why this chapter was presented in Part~II. This observation
illustrates that Chapter~\ref{chapter-approx} sits uncertainly between
Part~II and Part~III of this thesis.)
