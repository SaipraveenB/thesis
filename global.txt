NOTES:

Simulaneous substitutions: ALWAYS ALL LF (in the \lf{} color)

STABLE NEGATIVE PROPOSITIONS
POSITIVE SUSPENDED PROPOSITIONS
FOCUSED NEGATIVE PROPOSITIONS
INVERTING POSITIVE PROPOSITIONS

Mobile-ephemeral-linear, eph vs. lin. Worry about it?

CHANGES TO KEEP IN MIND:

In Chapter 4 we
NOT
In Chapter 4, we

"matches" should always be mboxed

\smallskip before and after {enumerate} or {itemize}

Consider grepping "unification" everywhere and always trying to 
say something better.

VARIABLE DECLARATION not mapping

Realization: inductive definitions aren't partial, proofs are partial
(LF view versus math view)


CHANGES TO CONSIDER MAKING:

springer LNCS not fully consistent. Editors? Location?

"Only" seems to be a pretty common weasel word for me: global check.

Page number from our LFMTP paper.

Chatper~\ref{}?

I removed some asterisk conditions from the last proof in 6.1; double
check against the POPL version of the revised theorem that I didn't
do anything sketchy.
