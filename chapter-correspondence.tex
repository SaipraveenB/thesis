\chapter{On logical correspondence}

In Part 1, we defined \sls, the logical framework of substructural
logical specifications. For the purposes of this thesis, we are
primarily interested in using \sls~as a framework for specifying the
operational semantics of programming languages, especially stateful
and concurrent programming languages. This is not a new idea:
specifying the operational semantics of programming languages is one
of the examples used to illustrate the expressiveness of the original
CLF specifiacation \cite{cervesato02concurrent}, a specification style
that was later termed {\it substructural operational semantics} by
Pfenning \cite{pfenning04substructural}. The general idea of
representing the intermediate states of a computation as substructural
process states dates back to Miller \cite{miller92pi} and his
Ph.D. student Chirimar \cite{chirimar95proof}, who encoded the
intermediate states of a $\pi$-calculus and of a low-level RISC
machine (respectively) as contexts in focused classical linear logic.

\sls~has an extremely rich set of tools for specifying concurrent
computation. In order to make sense of the design space of
substructural operational semantics, we need some design principles, a
methodology that allows us to both {\it classify} different styles of
presentation and {\it predict}, based on our knowledge about a
language's features, what style we should adopt. In this chapter and
the subsequent chapter; each specification style is strictly more
expressive than the last.

\begin{itemize}
\item The {\it natural semantics}, or big-step operational semantics, is
  an existing well-known specifications style that is convienent for
  the specification of pure and determinstic programming languages.
  State is inconvienent to describe, and language features that deal
  with nondeterminism and non-local control are very difficult to
  describe.

\item The {\it ordered abstract machine semantics} is a generalization of
  abstract 

\item {\it Destination-passing semantics} are the style of
  substructural operational semantics
\end{itemize}

 we will explore three styles of specification,
where each is strictly more expressive than the last.

\subsection*{Functional correspondence}

To make a carefully-chosen analogy, various on-paper styles of
specifying the operational semantics are well-known and visually
recongizable.  To anyone literate in the conventions of programming
languages researchers, a quick glance should be sufficent to classify
the following two rules as natural semantics (or big-step semantics)
for the call-by-value lambda calculus:
\[
\infer
{\lambda x. e \Downarrow \lambda x. e \mathstrut}
{}
\quad
\infer
{e_1\,e_2 \Downarrow v \mathstrut}
{e_1 \Downarrow \lambda x.e
 &
 e_2 \Downarrow v_2
 &
 [v_2/x]e \Downarrow v \mathstrut}
\]
Natural semantics are a clean, high-level, and declarative way of
describing the semantics of a simple, pure programming langauges, but
they do not scale particularly well with the addition of effects like
state and exceptions. Worse, natural semantics are mostly hopeless in
the face of languages features that incoroprate nondeterminism or
advanced control (such as first-class continuations). Furthermore,
natural semantics is not very good as an {\it operational semantics},
as it describes {\it what} a program may compute, but not how: many
issues, such as the order of operations, are unspecified.

Thus, a researcher interested in a simple, high level specification of
the core features of a functional programming language might
reasonably predict that natural semantics would be a good solution to
their problem; one example is Murphy VII, who used natural semantics
for the high-level formalization of Lambda 5 in his thesis
\cite{murphy08modal}.

Another style used to specify the operational semantics of programming
languages, he {\it abstract
  machine} semantics, is slightly less canonical but nevertheless has
an identifiable set of conventions. The following is an abstract 
machine semantics for our call-by-value lambda calculus:
\[
\infer
{k \rhd (\lambda x. e) ~\mapsto~ k \lhd (\lambda x. e) \mathstrut} 
{}
\quad
\infer
{k \rhd (e_1\,e_2) ~\mapsto~ (k; \Box\,e_2) \rhd e_1 \mathstrut}
{}
\]\[
\infer
{(k; \Box\,e_2) \lhd (\lambda x.e) ~\mapsto~ (k; (\lambda x.e)\Box) \rhd e_2
 \mathstrut}
{}
\quad
\infer
{(k; (\lambda x.e)\Box) \lhd v_2 ~\mapsto~ k \rhd [v_2/x]e
 \mathstrut}
{}
\]

 for programming languages, t, is slightly less canonical, but abstract machine
specifications nevertheless also have a set of common
conventions. There are two states in an abstract machine
specification, $k \rhd e$ (the expression $e$ is evaluating on top of
stack $k$) and $k \lhd v$ (the value $v$ is being returned to the top
of the stack $k$). The first rule says that, as a funtion $\lambda x.e$
is already a value, we proceed by returning it to the stack, whereas
for an application $e_1\,e_2$, 


There needs to be some structure and
at least


the design space
of 

 the general idea
of representing intermedeiate states of a computation as 
substructural process states

No check for pointer inequality! This is a fundamental restriction of

\subsection{Evaluation contexts}

Thus far, we have considered big-step operational semantics and abstract
machines, neglecting the third great tradition of programming language
specification, {\it structural operational semantics}. Structural
operational semantics (SOS) define single-step evaluation inductively over
the structure of expressions; the SOS semantics for our running example
language is the following:
\[
\infer
{\lambda x.e\,{\sf value} \mathstrut}
{}
\quad
\infer
{e_1\,e_2 \mapsto e_1'\,e_2 \mathstrut}
{e_1 \mapsto e_1' \mathstrut}
\quad
\infer
{e_1\,e_2 \mapsto e_1\,e_2' \mathstrut}
{e_1\,{\sf value}
 &
 e_2 \mapsto e_2' \mathstrut}
\quad
\infer
{(\lambda x. e)v \mapsto [v/x]e \mathstrut}
{v\,{\sf value} \mathstrut}
\]
This inductive specification is adequately encoded on the left-hand
side of Figure~\ref{fig:cbv-sos}, along with the proposition \Verb|ev|
that describes a big-step operational semantics in terms of repeated
application of the small-step operational semantics.

There are a couple of possibilities for how the 
One obvious way to proceed is to simply translate the big-step portion
of our semantics as encoded 


If we just translate the {\it steps} portion of the semantics (using
the tail-recursion optimizing translation), then we will get what is
probabily fair to call the most boring possible substructural
operational semantics: 

\smallskip
\VerbatimInput{sls/cbv-sos-proc.sls}

\noindent
Under this semantics, the substructural context contains a single
resource, \Verb|eval-steps(E)|, which takes steps according to the
rules of the small-step structural operational semantics until a value
is reached, at which point the context contains \Verb|retn-steps(V)|.

The interesting observations are to be had from the other direction: what if

\subsection{Temporal logic}

The natural semantics of \rowan~are not, on a superficial level,
significantly more complex than other natural semantics. However, it
turns out that the usual set of techniques for adding state to a
natural semantics break down, and discussing a \rowan-like logic with
state remained a challenge for many years.\robnote{Figure out from
  Rowan what the recent work he told you about was.} Through the
logical correspondance, it is easy to see why: the natural SSOS
specification of \rowan~integrates both concurrent and deductive
reasoning in an arbitrarily nested way. In fact, Figure XXX is the
only SLS specification in this thesis that exhibits this form of
recursive dependency between concurrent and deductive reasoning.  In
particular, the \rowan~specification is way out of the image of the
extended natural semantics we considered in
Section~\ref{sec:enriching-natsem}. The natural encoding in state lies
in the ambient substructural context of a concurrent computation, but
that ambient computation cannot properly enter into a deductive
sub-computation. If we tried to add state to \rowan~the same way we
added it in Section~\ref{sec:mutable-storage}, the entire store
would effectively leave scope whenever computation considered
the subterm $e$ of ${\sf next}(e)$. That consideration happens
as deductive reasoning, not as concurrent reasoning!

 it is the only we
will consider in this thesis that has with property.

It's hard to include state in temporal logic! But the logical correspondence
helps us understand why: the natural SSOS specification of
